4    Createing a source archive for Synchronet release 3.15a from the CVS repository.
    
Note that this version of the procedure uses the pre-compiled library file for cryptlib.

    
cd /path/to/working/directory

    # Download sbbs_src.tgz from ftp://ftp.synchro.net/Synchronet/sbbs_src.tgz

    # Extract contents of source archive to working directory. Can then
    # delete include/microsoft, include/mozilla, include/sdl;  they are not needed.
    # Delete src/sbbs3/menuedit;  per author, it is not a currently maintained project.
    
    # Replace libcl.so with a symlink from libcl.so & libcl.so.3 to libcl.so.3.3.0 
cd lib/cryptlib/linux.release
ln -s libcl.so.3.3.0 libcl.so
ln -s libcl.so.3.3.0 libcl.so.3
    # this is needed for the package build (needs to be redone if doing multiple builds)
ln -s `pwd`/libcl.so.3.3.0 /usr/lib/libcl.so

    # Get the required modules for running Synchronet by downloading sbbs_run.tgz from
    # ftp://ftp.synchro.net/Synchronet/sbbs_run.tgz and extracting that to the working directory.
    # Exclude docs/js/guide & docs/js/ref or delete afterwards if needed to save space.
    # Also exclude or delete afterwards the directory web/root/telnet/tools.
    # Delete web/root/images/nightshade/Thumbs.db (Unneeded and it causes a Lintian warning.)
    
    # Copy debian directory to working directory
    
    # Update debian/changelog as neccessary.		
    
    # To just build a binary package, where "name@example.org" is your email address.
debuild --no-lintian -rfakeroot -ename@example.org  -us -uc -b
