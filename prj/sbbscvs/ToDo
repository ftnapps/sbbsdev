ToDo for sbbscvs - SBBS from CVS Archives
----------------------------------------------

- This package is intended to install Synchonet BBS as sbbscvs, so that
  it can be installed alongside of a working SBBS installation.  Create
  a script that just adapts the main Synrhonet debian directory by 
  changing names as neccessary from "synchronet" to "sbbscvs."

- The part of script for building sbbscvs should set debian/changelog.
