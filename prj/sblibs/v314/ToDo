ToDo - sblibs-314
-----------------

- the libcl.so file needs to be unversioned for sbbs to see it, so that needs to
be adjusted in the package;  moved sym link setting from -dev to main package?

- Need to make sblibs conflict with the package libcl? (Which would 
presumably be an actual build package of cryptlib instead of just using
the already built version from the sync archive being used in sblibs.)

- The COPYING & README files for the libcl can be put in with the debian package,
but doesn't it need to be in the source archive as well?
