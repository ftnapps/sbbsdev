The Syncrhonet BBS Cryptlib library debian package is derived from the
one compiled for use with the Synchronet BBS Source archive and distributed
with that source archive.

cryptlib is distributed under a dual license that allows free, open-source use
under a GPL-compatible license and closed-source use under a standard
commercial license.  The GPL-compatible license (a.k.a. the Sleepycat license)
is given below.  Further details on this license are available from the
cryptlib home page.
