Synchronet packageing for Debian
--------------------------------

    After configureing Synchronet, set SBBSDEV_ENABLE to Yes in /etc/default/sbbsdev.

    This version of the package uses a pre-compiled version of the cryptlib
library and is therefore not ready for inclusion into the Debian distribution.
