Description: add encryption and authentication services to software
 cryptlib consists of a set of layered security services and associated
 programming interfaces that provide an integrated set of information and
 communications security capabilities. Much like the network reference model,
 cryptlib contains a series of layers that provide each level of abstraction,
 with higher layers building on the capabilities provided by the lower layers.
 This is the runtime package for the library, derived from the source
 package for Synchronet BBS.
